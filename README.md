# Fine-tuning-LLM-based-on-Leukemia-The-blood-cancer
This repository holds code and resources related to the tuning of a large language model in support of leukemia research, covering subtypes of the given blood cancer, treatment options, and genetic markers. Armed with state-of-the-art NLP techniques, the current project is proposed to become a high-impact tool for researchers and health professionals in analyzing vast medical literature, clinical trial data, and genetic information related to leukemia.

Features:
Fine-tuning of a pre-trained model: A pre-trained LLM is fine-tuned in literature review, summarization, and data extraction in regard to specific leukemia tasks. In an addition, it includes datasets specific to leukemia with genetic markers, patient results, and treatment protocols. The same enables the end user to query the model for any specific insights or generate summaries on topics related to leukemia. Finally, it assists researchers in the identification of relevant clinical trials to their leukemia research and summarizes the results.
Customizable workflows: Easy integration with existing pipelines and tools in order to personalize leukemia research.
